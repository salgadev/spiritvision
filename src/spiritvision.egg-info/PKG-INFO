        Multi-Class Image Classification of evaporated mezcal drops using fastai and PyTorch. Web App deployed
        on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/socd06/mezcal/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fvoila%2Frender%2Fapp.ipynb).

        ## Background
        
        Mezcal is a spirit originally produced in Mexico. There are many varieties of mezcal depending on the agave plant used
        its
        production, each with its own flavour and intricacies. For example, *espadín* has an earthy flavor as opposed to
        *tobalá*, which has subtle smoky notes.
        
        ## The Challenge
        
        Mezcal has a very strict and exhaustive quality control authentication and certification method in which sampled drops
        of mezcal are chemically analyzed via mass spectrophotometry. In this project, we attempt to authenticate different
        mezcal types using image classification models trained in evaporated mezcal drops seen under a microscope.
        
        ## Technologies used
        
        Python, fastai, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Voilà
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        1. Get and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and an IDE of your choice
           (e.g. [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) or [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/))
        2. Make a virtual environment -- *will depend on your IDE* -- (Optional)
        3. Install dependencies using the terminal
            ```
            pip install -r requirements.txt
            ```
        4. Try out the Jupyter Notebooks and/or the training script
