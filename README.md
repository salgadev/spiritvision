# SpiritVision 
Multi-Class Image Classification of evaporated mezcal drops using OpenCv, PyTorch and fastai. Web App deployed on [HuggingFace Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/salgadev/spiritvision-demo).

## Background
Mezcal is a spirit originally produced in Mexico. There are many varieties of mezcal depending on the agave plant used its production, each with its own flavour and intricacies. For example, *espadín* has an earthy flavor as opposed to *tobalá*, which has subtle smoky notes.

## The Challenge
Mezcal has a very strict and exhaustive quality control authentication and certification method in which sampled drops of mezcal are chemically analyzed via mass spectrophotometry. In this project, we attempt to authenticate different mezcal types using image classification models trained in evaporated mezcal drops seen under a microscope.

## Technologies used
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [fastai](https://www.fast.ai/) 

## Local Setup
1. Get and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and an IDE of your choice
   (e.g. [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) or [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/))
2. Make a virtual environment -- *will depend on your IDE* -- (Optional)
3. Install dependencies, for example, using the terminal
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Try the Notebooks directory and/or the training script
